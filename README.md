Allie – AI Voice and Sign Assistant
Allie is a new Android app that helps close the communication gap for people that are deaf or hard of hearing. This intelligent assistant does much more than just convert spoken language into sign language through expressive GIFs. It also knows many hand gestures, recognizes them through the camera, and can perform useful tasks like launching popular apps like YouTube or the phone dialer on command!

🌟 What Allie can do
🎤 Speech to sign language
Allie says to listen to a spoken language using the SpeechRecognizer built into Android and converts it to sign language. Instead of displaying plain text, Allie will provide meaningful sign language GIFs that visually represent commonly spoken phrases or words. This speaks volumes for educational settings or conversations between people with different abilities.


✋ Hand gesture recognition
Allie uses MediaPipe and TensorFlow Lite to detect and classify hand gestures through the device camera in real time. These hand gestures are mapped to specific actions. For example, a hand gesture representing a "Hello" generates a greeting sign that Allie displays, while another hand gesture could open the Youtube app with one command.

📱 App Launching through Gestures
Users can simply perform hand gestures to launch commonly utilized applications while video calling. Allie recognizes gestures to launch apps like:
YouTube – to watch or search for videos
whatsapp – to place phone calls

This hands-free feature offers accessibility and convenience, especially for those who may struggle with touchscreen menus.

🛠️ Built With
Kotlin (Android Studio) – to Develop the core Android application
MediaPipe – for hand landmark detection in real-time
TensorFlow Lite – to perform lightweight, gesture classification in-app
Android SpeechRecognizer API – for recognizing spoken text as an input, which is then mapped to GIF-based sign language

👥 Who Is It For?
This app is designed specifically for:
Deaf/mute individuals – so they can visual signs to better understand spoken language.
Educators/careters – that work with or teach someone with hearing impairments.
